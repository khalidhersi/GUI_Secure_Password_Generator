## General Info
The program creates dynamically changing passwords that have the following requirements: 
- 1 to 4 uppercase letters from A to Z, 
- 1 to 4 lowercase letters from a to z, 
- 1 to 4 digits from 0 to 9, 
- 1 to 4 punctuation signs such as !, ?, â€œ, # etc.

Each requirement is randomly generated making the password very secure.
The password changes every time the program is run ensuring a new random password which can never be broken.
When the project is run a GUI popup will appear that shows the dynamically changing secure Password
